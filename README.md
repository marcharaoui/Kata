Kata: number to french converter

## Introduction

This work is done on Python and the goal is to take a list of int numbers and to translate them in french using a list of strings.

## How to use
This is a Python package that has the following scripts:
- **main.py:** This script is the main script, it takes an input dataset and will output the final result. To do so, it uses the other scripts,
- **convert_data.py:** This script takes a number, analyses it and outputs the corresponding string values,
- **better_convert.py:** This script is an improved version of 'convert_data.py' based suggestions by ChatGPT,
- **check_data.py:** This script checks if the dataset has the right structure and types. It needs to be a list of ints.

Open a terminal in the project directory, and run the following command line: `python main.py`.
